							<h2>Personal Information</h2>
							<p>Hello, my name is Nguyen Quoc Thang, id 3806617. I’m from Hanoi and just move in Ho Chi Minh city recently. I’m still adjusting to the new environment but so far it’s been pretty exciting and fun. I speak Vietnamese and fluent in English (I hope). I really like animal (especially dog). In my free time, I like to play basketball and football. I also very like MMA (Mixed Martial Art) and I’m currently taking a MMA class. I can play the piano as well and I really like to watch movies. My favorite director is Christopher Nolan. If you have any movie suggestions for me you can leave it in the feedback which I’ll be very happy to check out.</p>

							<h2>Interest in IT </h2>
							<p>I was always fascinated by the mechanism of things, how things operated? at a very young age. That’s why when I knew about coding and coding program like python,c,c++, I was very excited as I could finally create something by myself. But it turns out that programming is a lot harder than I thought. Even for something simple to run it would take lines of code, which is not always easy to put together and run smoothly. Nevertheless, I find it even more interesting as unlike other subject, a problem in IT can have hundreds of solutions. There is no fixed steps that I have to follow in order to solve the problem. I can come up with any kind of answer I want as long as it is correct. This is also one of the main reason why I like IT because it can increase my creativity as I always have to think of the shortest solution out of thousands of other solutions. </p>
                            <p>So far I haven’t had any experience in IT yet but I’m very eager to learn and gain experience in working with my classmate on the upcoming projects. </p>
                            <p>I chose RMIT because the school has a great facility and really welcoming staff. Unlike other university, RMIT really provide a practical learning experience as senior students can spend half of their last year on internship to other firms to gain valuable experience. Also RMIT provide a very dynamic and active environment with both academic and sport activities. With more than 50 clubs to choose from, I can easily find friend with common interest. I also want to study abroad so RMIT exchange program really suits me as RMIT is in the top 5 universities for international exchange. </p>
                            <p>I’m expecting to gain more knowledge in IT, software programming, be able to use coding language like Pascal, C, C ++, C #, Python,etc.. smoothly, basic understanding of HTML5, Java, to participate in many IT projects that will help me to gain experience and build my portfolio. I’m also looking forward to making new friends that will help me throughout the school year and have some fun together.</p>

							<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
							<p>My ideal job is to be a Cyber security manager. The Cyber security manager’s job is to protect the company’s server from cyber breaches like malware, cyber-attacks, information leaking ,etc.., train staffs on proper use of the company’s IT infrastructure, planning security measures and managing risks. The main reason that I like this job is because of the flexible working hour. Unlike other IT related jobs, I can just work from home as long as I get the work done. Another perk of this job is that you can work with the latest technology used by professionals in this field, which is the best for a tech savvy like me. This is also a very promising career with very high employment rate. According to Cyber Seek, there will be more than 1.8 millions unfilled cyber security jobs opening in 2022. Because of the scarcity of the workers in this field, companies usually present qualified recruits with highly attractive salary with benefits packages. </p>
                            <p>The job requires it’s applicants to have a high gpa (3.5 or higher), strong interpersonal skills, experienced in cyber security and end point security, obtain a CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional), at least 3 years working in a security-focused or analyst role. This is just my first year in RMIT so I’ll try my best to have and maintain a high gpa throughout my academic school year. I don’t have any experience in cyber security yet but I’ll try to seek out internship or data security related projects in my second year  to increase my group working skills as well as to build up my cv. Many companies like VNG or start up companies like Grab provide internship for as young as second year students. I will also take online courses in cyber security such as web security fundamental offered by Coursea to have some basic understanding. </p>

							<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
							<p>I think that the result of all three test is very accurate. The Myers-Briggs test and adobe creative test describe exactly my personality. I’m a very outgoing and creative person. I see the best in people. When facing with a problem, I always try to find the most creative and efficient solution. While most people fear changes, for me, It is a chance to gain more knowledge and experience. I really like to challenge myself by setting up big goals to accomplish or trying to adapt to new environment whenever I got the chance. This is the main reason why I chose to study in RMIT Ho Chi Minh rather than RMIT Ha Noi. The learning style test is also fairly accurate. I find myself to study more efficiently when I can see example to the problems or when I can actually solve the problem myself. I’m not the biggest fan of just sitting in the theatre and listening to lectures but I’m more excited for real practices in the computer lab. </p>
                            <p>I think that I will be a very active person in a team. I always like to come up with new and unique ideas. I’m also a proactive person so if thing goes sideway and the group leader doesn’t do anything, I’m very likely to take charge to take a hold of the situation rather than just sit out and wait for the consequence.</p>
                            <p>I think I will find people who is also creative and good at executing ideas like me. I don’t want to participate in a group where members put minimum effort into the project just to get a passable grade. I hold myself to a very high standard so when doing something I always give 100% of my time and effort to produce the best outcome.  The adobe creativity test also suggest me to team up with people with “the maker” personality type as they are people who is very patient and dedicate to take any ideas from concept to completion.  </p>

							<h2>My Project</h2>
							<p>I have always liked to find the shortest and most efficient solution to every of my problem. Most of the time, I’d find myself reviewing problem that already have the answer and try to find a faster way to do it. So for my project I want to develop an app for our school SAS (Student Academic Success) service.  </p>
                            <p>You must be wondering why our school SAS service need an app if it already has a website? Well, I have noticed that for first year students, most of them are usually snowed under with work and deadlines, have been struggling to catch up with the study pace of the university life or just can’t  keep up with all the classes , but none of them ever go to the SAS service for help or counseling at all . I personally think that our school SAS is a wonderful service that can provide real help and solutions to student’s problems. It has experienced people who have been master in certain majors or high-achieving students that can provide amazing academic support. But most students don’t understand this service or have not even heard of it. In my opinion, the lack of interactive features on the website and the inconvenience are some of the main reasons why not many students use the SAS service. 
You must be wondering how can the app solve those problems? 
</p>
                             <p>Well, First of all, Interactive function , the app will have a main feed where students can post their problems or questions on and anyone from the SAS team to other students can answer it. By doing this, we can create interesting forums which does not only help students to understand the subject more thoroughly but also help them to make more friends. Anyone who use the app will have a profile with detail information of what major they are in, their current study status, their personal achievements, etc,.. This will make it easier for students to connect with each other. </p>
                             <p>Secondly, convenience , with the current SAS website, you can’t send message to the SAS team and the only way you can contact them is either to book an appointment or meet them at their office during their working hours (which is changed everyday based on the subjects and the tutors). Many students that want counseling but are not free on those hours can’t find any other way to use the service at all.  But with the app, you will have a messaging tab in which you can text directly to the SAS tutors or the PAL team if you are having any questions. This will save both the SAS team and RMIT students a lot of time and it will also be a lot more convenient. </p>
                             <p>Thirdly, student reaching, SAS usually hold academic event or workshop that I find very useful as it is hosted by experienced senior students or alumni and in those events, many valuable tips and experience were shared. But usually very little students ever attend it and when I ask around most of my friends don’t even know that there is a workshop happening. That’s why the app will have a notification tab for whenever a workshop or a hearing is taking place and also a searching tab to find relatable information. </p>
                             <p>I want this to be a cross-platform app so I’ll have to use tool like adobe phonegap or appcelerator. I will have to prepare testing android, ios devices and mutiple powerful computer with chip like intel i7,ram of 16gb or more. I will also need a cloud service like google app engine or aws.</p>
                             <p>To be able to build this app, I will have to acquire experience in UI design, back end computing, quality testing and quality insurance, strong knowledge of HTML5, Java, Xib, Storyboard, have deep understanding of ios and android framework, all of which will take years for me to learn and have experienced in. So I think that this will be one of my future project. Finding a person with the suitable set of skills will be very hard, most likely to be senior students or alumni so I will have to do a lot of reaching out but I think that there are a lot of excellent students in RMIT, especially in the School of science and technology.  </p>
                             <p>Although SAS has a website, when you google it, it doesn’t show up on the search result at all but you have to find it in the RMIT main page, which is a lot more complicated from just clicking on an app. The messaging with the feed tab will make the SAS service more convenient and easier to access than ever. The SAS team can even utilize the feed function post regular asked question or topics that they found interesting that can be helpful for students. This app will help to draw a significant number of students to use the service. Thus helping more students to achieve higher marks on class. This will also help parents to be more assured in sending their children to study in RMIT as they know that there will be a very committed team of academic support that is always ready to help their children . All of the function above is just some that I can come up with at the moment and I think that there are still a lot more that can be added. This is a very diversity platform that if used right, can greatly promote the school as well. Maybe even making SAS an advantage of studying in RMIT rather than other international university.</p>
